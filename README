[NOTE Feb 2022:  BIDS error due to using "ctf" instead of "CTF" in the MEGCoordinateSystem field in coordinatesystem.  The thousands of files will not be changed unless a batch update is available.]

The MEG files contain a channel with triggers necessary for event marking and timing. Separate event files with onsets are provided in the participant directories for completeness only; the MEG triggers should be used for actual onsets in analysis. The delay between the trigger and the visual onset of an on-screen event sent by the projector is approximately 20 ms, as estimated using a photodiode.

Memory phase triggers: At the onset of a trial, the first trigger represents the category (1-8) of the on-screen image. Categories 1-6 represent actual stimulus categories. Trigger values ofÂ 7 and 8 represent the 4 positive and 4 negative story-ending stimuli, respectively. The onset of the answer, approximately 5.5 sec later, is marked by a trigger value of 11.

Localizer phase triggers: As in the memory phase, at the onset of a trial, the first trigger represents the category (1-8) of the on-screen image. Categories 1-6 represent true categories. Trigger values of 7 and 8 represent the 4 positive and 4 negative story-ending stimuli, respectively. For a baseline, note that for the 2 s prior to picture onset, a word naming that picture was presented on the screen; thus, baseline values should be taken from data more than 2 s before the trigger onset.
